<summary>Recommended Stage Summary</summary>

The "Recommended" stage is the final milestone for an RFC. It provides a signal to the wider community to indicate that a feature has been put through its ecosystem paces and is ready to use.

To reach the "Recommended" stage, the following should be true:

If appropriate, the feature is integrated into the tutorial and the guides prose. API documentation is polished and updates are carried through to other areas of API docs that may not directly pertain to the feature.

If the proposal replaces an existing feature, the addon ecosystem has largely updated to work with both old and new features.

If the proposal updates or replaces an existing feature, high-quality codemods are available.

If needed, Ember debugging tools as well as popular IDE support have been updated to support the feature.

If the feature is part of a suite of features that were designed to work together for best ergonomics, the other features are also ready to be "Recommended".

Any criteria for "Recommended" for this proposal that were established in the Ready For Release stage have been met.

An FCP is required to enter this stage. Multiple RFCs may be moved as a batch into "Recommended" with the same PR.
